<h1>Tokio</h1>
<p>Tokyo is often referred to as a city, but is officially known and governed as a "metropolitan prefecture",
    which differs from and combines elements of a city and a prefecture, a characteristic unique to Tokyo. </p>
<p>TTokyo ranked first in the Global Economic Power Index and third in the Global Cities Index. The city is considered an alpha+ world city – as
    listed by the GaWC's 2008 inventory[11] – and in 2014, Tokyo was ranked first in the "Best overall experience" category of TripAdvisor's World City Survey (the city also ranked first in the following categories: "helpfulness of locals", "nightlife", "shopping", "local public transportation" and "cleanliness of streets").</p>
